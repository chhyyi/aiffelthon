# Red tide prediction model
As a member of team redzone, I'm working on red tide prediction model nowadays. This team is formed to attends AIFFELTHON, which is final stage of AIFFEL. AIFFEL is a deep learning traning course by Modulabs, Korea.

## merged with lms directory
I had separated workplace in Aiffel's LMS server. So I merged. But this directory need some arrangement while they contains too many duplicates.

## CVAE\_POC
from the copy of [elemisi's CVAE github repo](https://www.github.io/elemisi/ConditionalVAE), I've made some notebooks and modified python scrips. But it is now separated to [rz\_cvae](github.io/chhyyi/rz_cvae).
