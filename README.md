# Red tide prediction model
As a member of team redzone, I'm working on red tide prediction model nowadays. This team is formed to attends AIFFELTHON, which is final stage of AIFFEL. AIFFEL is a deep learning traning course by Modulabs, Korea.
This is not team git repository. I've made this personally.
